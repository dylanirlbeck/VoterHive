VoterHive is a tool you can use to bring other like-minded citizens into the political process and help them elect a government that acts in their best interests. By texting the people you know best, you can use this app to break down the bureaucratic hurdles they face as they make their way through the electoral process, regardless of the state they reside or vote in.

VoterHive is now available on the App Store.
